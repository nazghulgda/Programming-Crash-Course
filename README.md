# nzghl Python and Django course part 001
Python and Django course for very beginners

If you are looking for basic knowledge about programming, you're 
in the right place. What I offer here is the knowledge I've 
collected by the time, and finally got myself up to share it.

A lots of things I'm putting here I have learned on bootcamp, 
but also, later on, getting deeper into knowledge I've gained.
However there was one thing, which cause me a little bit ... 
confused. Lots of courses, trainings or bootcamps gives really 
good and valuable knowledge, however ... I haven't found even one, 
which makes it right way and in right order. Usually, you need to 
already have some knowledge before joining such courses. Even, if 
sometimes not, the pace of learning is so high, that very basics 
need to be learned very quick, and remembered forever. I can 
understand that, because usually those basics are ... real basics, 
and people do not want to loose time for it. But ... that's the 
moment, when completely newbies are quitting. I want to change 
that part. Do not want to go quick through all lessons. Want to 
go thorough each as long, as it is needed for learner to understand 
all topics. Memorizing of everything is not a good way of learning. 
When you understand things, you will know them and remember forever. 

In matter of fact, the course can also help you with getting familiar 
with linux OS, which is crucial. Of course, I know some people 
programming in Windows, I even tried it by myself, but ... it's not 
that nice and easy, as in linux (or any unix-like) system. My 
personal preferences are actually also a little bit different, as 
I preffer to work on mac, but to be honest, the difference between 
mac and linux is just a graphical. Core is the same.

This is a first stage of the course. Here you will learn:
- How to install and use linux. I strongly recommend Ubuntu 
distribution, as it is user friendly, easy to work with and of course 
completely free.
- How to work in linux environement.
- What is GIT and why you need it.
- HTML and CSS - some basic prework.
- Python - as above, some basic things to get familiar with it.

At the very beginning you will also read some quite usefull things, 
which I strongly suggest to read and practice.

How it is all organized?

Every part will start with README.md file (like this one) which will 
cover basic information about what is included in course part you're 
going to start.

Each part, or module, like I'd like to call it, will 
be a separate GIT repository, which you should fork to your GITHub, 
clone to your computer and work on. That will be the best way for 
all of us. My repositories will stay clean and ready for next 
learners, and you will have all your files with you all the time.

A subfolders will contain a topics, which we will work on - also 
with README.md (containing lessons and tasks descriptions) and all 
files you will need to do your work. The number of subfolders will 
depend on topic and complexity they cover.
