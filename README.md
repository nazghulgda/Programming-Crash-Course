# nzghl Python and Django course part 001
Python and Django course for very beginners

In matter of fact, the course can also help you with getting familiar with linux OS, which is crucial. Of course, I know some people programming in Windows, I even tried it by myself, but ... it's not that nice and easy, as in linux (or any unix-like) system. My personal prefferences are actually also a little bit different, as I preffer to work on mac, but to be honest, the difference between mac and linux is just a graphical. Core is the same.

This is a first stage of the course. Here you will learn:
- How to install and use linux. I strongly recommend Ubuntu distribution, as it is user friendly, easy to work with and of course completely free.
- How to work in linux environement.
- What is GIT and why you need it.
- HTML and CSS - some basic prework.
- Python - as above, some basic things to get familiar with it.

At the very beginning you will also read some quite usefull things, which I strongly suggest to read and practice.

How it all is organized?
Every part will start with README.md file (like this one) which will cover basic information about what is included in course part you're goint to start. Each part, or module, like I'd like to call it, will be a separate GIT repository, which you should fork to your GITHub, clone to your computer and work on. That will be the best way for all of us. My repositories will stay clean and ready for next learners, and you will have all your files with you all the time.
A subfolders will contain a topics, which we will work on - also with README.md (containing lessons and tasks descriptions) and all files you will need to do your work. The number of subfolders will depend on topic and complexity they cover.
