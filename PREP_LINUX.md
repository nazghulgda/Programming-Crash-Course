## Course preparations - Linux  

As we are going to go through programming stuff, there's no other way like to do it
in unix-like environment. Why this choice? Well, as much developer, as many answers
can be. I can share my thoughts on this matter.

When I've been starting to learn programming I loved to use my mac. My reason, why
I like unix-like systems is their stability and security. I had so many troubles
using Windows laptops (I had to, as my main job is automation engineering), especially,
when network connections had poor conditions, or one of the programs stopped responding. 
Computer in those cases was unusable. But in unix-like system, you can just kill the
process, and continue your work.  
Next reason was hardware requirements. If Windows works not so fast on your laptop, Linux
will be much faster and reliable.  
Last (my) reason is a huge library of development tools, which gives you ... freedom
of choice :)

1. ### System installation

You will need a few things, to proceed with Linux installation:
* USB memory stick, at least 8GB
* ISO file with Linux
* Tool to create bootable USB stick

Theres a lot of Linux distribution available (Arch, Debian, Mint etc.), however
Ubuntu seems to be most popular, and easiest to start with. To create bootable
USB stick with installation, you need to download ISO image from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
Choose a version with LTS (Long Time Support), as it is longer supported.

Next step will be to download a tool, that will make your USB stock bootable
with written ISO image on it. Again, there's big choice of such tools, however
I always use Rufus (download from [here](https://rufus.ie/en/)).

Now we will go through preparation of your installation media:
After you open Rufus, you see something like on picture below:


2. ### Linux basic commands and configuration
